			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>Small Plant Monitor

				A comprehensive product that inculcates the combination of hardware and software, which works to meet the needs and wants of plants in indoor farming (rare or seasonal plants), it will prodvide a controlled environment as well as automation services for watering and temperature control and finally it will utilize thermal imaging for disease detection.
				
				Problem Statement: Indoor farming of rare or seasonal plants lacks a comprehensive solution for optimizing growth conditions and disease prevention. Existing methods lack integration of hardware and software to provide controlled environments, automated watering, temperature regulation, and disease detection through thermal imaging. This gap hinders scalability, efficiency, and sustainability in indoor farming practices.</p>

				<dt>
					1. What makes this product unique for indoor farming?
					</dt>
				<dd>
					Our product combines both hardware and software elements to cater specifically to the needs of rare or seasonal plants in indoor farming. It integrates features such as controlled environment provision, automated watering, temperature regulation, and disease detection through thermal imaging, setting it apart from traditional methods.</dd>
				<dt>2. How does the controlled environment feature work?</dt>
				<dd>The controlled environment feature utilizes sensors and actuators to maintain optimal conditions for plant growth, including factors like humidity, light intensity, and air quality. This ensures that plants receive the ideal environment they require for healthy development.</dd>
				<dt>3. Can you elaborate on the automation services provided for watering and temperature control?</dt>
				<dd>Our system automates the process of watering by monitoring soil moisture levels and dispensing water as needed. Similarly, temperature control is managed through sensors that regulate heating or cooling mechanisms to maintain the desired temperature range for the plants, reducing manual intervention and ensuring consistency.</dd>
				<dt>4. How does the thermal imaging feature contribute to disease detection?</dt>
				<dd>Thermal imaging technology is employed to detect variations in plant temperature, which can indicate the presence of diseases or stress. By identifying these anomalies early on, farmers can take proactive measures to prevent the spread of diseases and mitigate crop loss.
				</dd>
				<dt>5. How does this product address the scalability, efficiency, and sustainability of indoor farming practices?</dt>
				<dd>By offering a comprehensive solution that streamlines various aspects of indoor farming, our product enhances scalability by reducing manual labor and increasing productivity. The automation features improve efficiency by ensuring consistent care for plants, while the disease detection capability enhances sustainability by enabling timely interventions to protect crops.</dd>
